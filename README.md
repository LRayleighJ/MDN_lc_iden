# Mixture Density Network identifying binary lensing
## File structure

I tried to write something clear but failed.

* `dataprocessing`: doing some dataset process
* `network`: testing MDN
    
    * `netmodule`: main structure of network
    
    * `datamodule`: some functions for calculating and data processing
* `GRU`: testing RNN+ResNet+MDN
* `simudata`: generating simulation data
* `testnet`: testnet

If having some questions, please contact liuzrua@163.com, though he doesn't know how to deal these problems either.
